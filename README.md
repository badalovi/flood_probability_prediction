### Developing a simple ML model training workflow

This repository demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow for a specific kaggle competition problem, including feature preparation, feature selection, 
hyperparameter tuning, model fitting, and prediction.
<br>It is designed as a showcase to illustrate how to develop a proper machine learning workflow using Python and OOP properly while the goal is not to achieve the best possible model.
